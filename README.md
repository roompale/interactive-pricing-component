## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS
- Javascript

### Continued development

I would like to learn better practices for progress display for range sliders.

I intend to work on better organising my code as well. I've not been particularly mindful with making my Javascript functions more easily shared and understood.

**Note: Delete this note and the content within this section and replace with your own plans for continued development.**
